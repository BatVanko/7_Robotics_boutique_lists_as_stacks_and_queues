# 7_Robotics_boutique_lists_as_stacks_and_queues
There is a robotics factory. The current project is assembly-line robots.
Each robot has a processing time – it is the time in seconds the robot needs to process a product. When a robot is free, it should take a product for processing and log its name, product, and processing start time.
Each robot processes a product coming from the assembly line. A product is coming from the line each second (so the first product should appear at [start time + 1 second]). If a product passes the line and there is not a free robot to take it, it should be queued at the end of the line again.
The robots are standing in the line in the order of their appearance.
Input
•	On the first line, you will receive the robots' names and their processing times in the format "robotName-processTime;robotName-processTime;robotName-processTime..."
•	On the second line, you will get the starting time in the format "hh:mm:ss"
•	Next, until the "End" command, you will get a product on each line.
Output 
•	Every time a robot takes a product, you should print: "{robotName} - {product} [hh:mm:ss]"
